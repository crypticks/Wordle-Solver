# wordle
A simple Python script with user-friendly GUI. It uses a list of about 13k words to make suggestions on what word to play next. Works pretty good I guess.

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

The input system is similar to that of Wordle itself. After typing out the word, you can click on each box to change the colour of it, as seen in the Wordle game. Pressing enter inputs this data and shows all possible words to the left of the input boxes. 
 
The green word at the top is the best recommended word as the next input. Yellow words are fairly good, and white words are... normal i guess? 
 
Instead of typing out the word from the list, you can also simply click on it and it gets autofilled. Your input history is stored on the right side. The window also has a Quit button on the Top Left side and a Reset button on the Bottom Right, in case you mess up any of the inputs, or get tired of how good this program is (*wink*)

PS: The following packages are needed:

	- collections
	- pynput
	- pygetwindow
	- tkinter
